    "Data reduction for near-infrared \\(NIR\\) images is similar to visible light images except for the added steps of removing the strong atmospheric background. Traditionally this was done using the software package [IRAF](http://iraf.noao.edu/) developed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory \\(NOAO\\). This set of tools is a little buggy, and newer generations of astronomers are turning to Python instead.\n",
